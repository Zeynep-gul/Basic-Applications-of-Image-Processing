# Basic-Applications-of-Image-Processing
This project performs basic image processing tasks on an image. The following operations have been implemented:

## 1. Displaying the Image in RGB, Grayscale, and Separated Color Channels
An image is loaded and displayed in RGB, Grayscale, and Separated Color Channels (R, G, B).
## 2. Histogram Analysis
The histograms of the image were visualized:
Color Histogram
Grayscale Histogram
Histograms of Separated Color Channels
## 3. Image Inversion
- The pixel values of the grayscale image were inverted to create a negative version of the image.
## 4. Image Mirroring
- The image was mirrored horizontally (horizontal flip).
## 5. RGB-Based Image Manipulations
- Various operations were applied to the RGB version of the image and the results were displayed.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
  
Install the required libraries with:
```python
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy

## Sample Outputs
- RGB, Grayscale, and Color Channels
- Histograms
- Inverted Image
- Mirrored Image
